# How to Use the Terminology Explorer

The Terminology Explorer is a powerful tool for searching, viewing, and translating medical terminology across different systems. This guide will help you make the most of its features.

## Search Tab

The Search tab allows you to find terminology codes and concepts across multiple systems.

1. **Enter a search term** in the search box
   - You can search by code (e.g., "SR11")
   - You can search by term (e.g., "Vata")
   - You can search by description keywords

2. **Select terminology systems** to include in your search
   - NAMASTE (National AYUSH Morbidity and Standardized Terminologies E-portal)
   - ICD-11 TM2 (International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision, Traditional Medicine Module 2)
   - Unani terminology
   - ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision)

3. **Click Search** to find matching terms
   - Results will display with the terminology system, code, and description
   - Some results may include additional information like definitions or mappings

4. **Click on a result** to view more detailed information

## Details Tab

The Details tab provides comprehensive information about a selected terminology code.

1. **Code and System Information** at the top shows the basic identifier
   - The terminology system (e.g., NAMASTE, ICD-11 TM2)
   - The specific code value
   - The term display name

2. **Definition** explains the meaning and context of the term

3. **Translations & Designations** show how the term is represented in different languages
   - Sanskrit (sa)
   - Hindi (hi)
   - And other languages as available

4. **Mappings & Related Codes** show equivalent terms in other terminology systems
   - Shows how this code maps to other systems
   - Includes equivalence type (e.g., "equivalent", "broader", "narrower")
   - May include mapping comments or notes

## Translate Tab

The Translate tab allows you to convert codes between different terminology systems.

1. **Select Source System** from the dropdown
   - Choose the system that contains your starting code

2. **Enter Source Code** you want to translate
   - Type the specific code (e.g., "SR11" for NAMASTE)

3. **Select Target System** for translation
   - Choose the system you want to translate the code into

4. **Click Translate Code** to view mappings
   - The results will show the source code details
   - Equivalent codes in the target system will be displayed
   - Equivalence type and any mapping comments will be shown

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Start with broad searches** and narrow down as needed
2. **Check mappings carefully** as equivalence may not always be perfect
3. **Use the translation feature** to verify cross-system compatibility
4. **Explore related codes** to understand the context of terms
5. **Note any mapping comments** which often contain important usage guidance

## Common Questions

**Q: Why can't I find a specific term?**
A: Some traditional medicine concepts may not have exact mappings in all systems. Try searching for related terms or using partial words.

**Q: What does "equivalence" mean?**
A: Equivalence indicates how closely matched the codes are between systems:
- "equivalent" means the concepts are essentially the same
- "broader" means the target concept includes more than the source
- "narrower" means the target concept is more specific than the source

**Q: How can I save or export my results?**
A: Currently, you can copy the information manually. Export functionality will be added in a future update.
