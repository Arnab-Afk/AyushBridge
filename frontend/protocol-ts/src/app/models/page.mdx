# FHIR Models

## Overview {{ anchor: false, id: 'overview' }}

AyushBridge implements FHIR R4 (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard for healthcare data exchange and terminology services. FHIR defines a set of modular components called "resources" that can be assembled into working systems. This page provides an overview of the key FHIR resources supported by AyushBridge. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Core Resources {{ anchor: false, id: 'core-resources' }}

### Patient
The Patient resource represents a human patient actor and administrative details about that patient. In AyushBridge, Patient resources are used to identify individuals receiving traditional medicine care.

**Key Properties:**
- Demographics (name, gender, birth date)
- Contact information
- Identifiers (ABHA ID, medical record numbers)
- Managing organization

### Condition
Represents a clinical condition, problem, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical concept that has risen to a level of concern. Used for documenting traditional medicine diagnoses and NAMASTE-coded conditions.

**Key Properties:**
- Clinical status
- Verification status
- Category (problem-list-item, encounter-diagnosis)
- Code (NAMASTE or ICD-11 TM2 codes)
- Subject (Patient reference)

## Terminology Resources {{ anchor: false, id: 'terminology-resources' }}

### CodeSystem
Defines a set of codes with meanings. AyushBridge supports multiple code systems including NAMASTE, ICD-11 TM2, and WHO Standardized International Terminologies for Ayurveda.

**Supported Code Systems:**
- **NAMASTE**: National AYUSH Morbidity & Standardized Terminologies Electronic
- **ICD-11 TM2**: WHO ICD-11 Traditional Medicine Module 2
- **WHO Ayurveda**: International standardized Ayurvedic terminology

**Key Operations:**
- `$lookup`: Get details of a code
- `$validate-code`: Validate if a code exists in the system
- `$subsumes`: Check code relationships

### ValueSet
A set of codes drawn from one or more code systems. Used to define the set of valid codes for specific use cases in traditional medicine documentation.

**Key Properties:**
- URL identifier
- Version information
- Included code systems
- Expansion capabilities

### ConceptMap
Defines mappings between concepts defined in different code systems. Essential for translating between NAMASTE, ICD-11 TM2, and biomedical terminologies.

**Mapping Types:**
- NAMASTE → ICD-11 TM2
- ICD-11 TM2 → Biomedical codes
- Bidirectional mappings with confidence scores

**Key Operations:**
- `$translate`: Convert codes between systems
- `$closure`: Find related concepts

## Clinical Resources {{ anchor: false, id: 'clinical-resources' }}

### Observation
Measurements and simple assertions made about a patient. Used for documenting traditional medicine assessments and vital signs.

**Key Properties:**
- Status
- Category
- Code
- Subject (Patient)
- Value (quantity, codeable concept, etc.)
- Effective date/time

### Procedure
An action that is performed on or for a patient as part of the provision of care. Documents traditional medicine treatments and interventions.

**Key Properties:**
- Status
- Code (treatment procedure)
- Subject (Patient)
- Performed date/time
- Performer

## Infrastructure Resources {{ anchor: false, id: 'infrastructure-resources' }}

### Bundle
A container for a collection of resources. Used for batch operations, transaction bundles, and search result sets.

**Bundle Types:**
- `transaction`: Atomic operations
- `batch`: Independent operations
- `searchset`: Search results
- `history`: Version history

### CapabilityStatement
Defines the capabilities of a FHIR server. Describes supported resources, operations, and conformance to FHIR standards.

### AuditEvent
Record of an event relevant for auditing purposes. Tracks all operations for compliance and security monitoring.

**Key Properties:**
- Event type
- Timestamp
- Agent (who performed the action)
- Entity (what was accessed)
- Outcome
